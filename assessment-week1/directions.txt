code in branch named according to your first name, lowercase (with last initial as needed).
two projects, a library project and a unit test project.
library should have a class that can tell me whether a string is a palindrome or not.
all the behavior of the class should be unit tested.
a palindrome reads the same forwards and backwards.
for example, these should be considered palindromes:
    "nurses run"
    "racecaR"
    "1221"
    "never odd, or even."
for example, these should not be considered palindromes:
    "one two one"
    "123abccba123"
follow best practices.
